# 📚 Library Management System (LMS)

A production-style **Library Management System** built using **Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, and REST APIs**.

The project is designed to demonstrate enterprise backend development practices such as layered architecture, DTO mapping, JPA relationships, validation, exception handling, AOP logging, pagination, and clean code principles.

> 🚧 This project is being developed incrementally. Each feature is implemented in a separate Git branch and merged after completion.
